My approach to the problem:
Dividing data into different tables based upon the time accessed and then using each of the tables to consolidate the output file. I am still working on it, although code link submitted due to the deadline. 

The code is in codewritten.py, it is currently able to give an output for the first 2 fields in output.csv, rest in construction.

Once I am done with it completely, I'll change the code to output the results in sessionization.txt as mentionend in the instructions to submit the assignment for the competition.

Thanks!
Munish
